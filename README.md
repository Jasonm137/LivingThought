# Theory of Living Thought: A Theory of Life, Soul, and Unity

## Overview

The Theory of Living Thought Storage and Analysis System (TLTSAS) represents a comprehensive framework designed to uncover and elucidate the interconnectedness and reality of everything, using a foundational approach grounded in the core fields of human knowledge. By sorting knowledge from the past, present, and future, the theory illuminates critical aspects of human existence, the nature of higher-level thought processes, and ultimate goals. It posits that learning across diverse disciplines equips individuals with unique yet interconnected skills, categorized into three realms: social, natural, and spiritual. These realms contribute to understanding the structure, qualities, and trajectory of entities, providing a holistic view of the universe, society, and individual consciousness.

## Purpose

The theory tries to find and explain the links and reality of everything. It uses the most basic and core fields of human knowledge to sort past, present, and future knowledge. This sorting shows important features of humans, and what may cause higher-level thought and goals. Learning different subjects gives people skills to use and control these features. These skills are different, but related, and they belong to 3 realms, the social, the natural, and the spiritual. The three parts of each realm work together to make three parts of anything, its structure, its qualities, and its path. The theory only works for entities. The theory has three kinds of entities as examples.

## Principles of Living Thought

1. **Principle of Knowledge**:
   - **Complexity**: Acknowledges the intricate nature of entities and their interactions within the universe.
   - **Interconnectedness**: Highlights the fundamental connections among all forms of knowledge and entities.
