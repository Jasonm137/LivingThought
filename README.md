# The Theory of Living Thought: A System for Life, Soul, and Unity

## Overview

The Theory of Living Thought (TLT) presents an integrative framework aimed at understanding the interconnections and realities of life, soul, and unity through a multidisciplinary lens. By synthesizing the core fields of human knowledge, TLT seeks to categorize and interpret the vast expanse of past, present, and future knowledge, revealing the intricacies of human capabilities, higher-level thought processes, and overarching goals. This system underscores the importance of diverse learning and the application of knowledge across the social, natural, and spiritual realms to foster a comprehensive understanding of life's structure, attributes, and trajectory.

## Purpose

TLT endeavors to elucidate the connections among all things, employing an analytical yet holistic approach to study the relationships within and between the realms of society, nature, and spirit. Through this, it aims to uncover the mechanisms behind human thought, evolution, and the pursuit of higher consciousness and unity.

## Principles of Living Thought

The theory is grounded in three main principles, each highlighting essential aspects of entities within the theory's scope:

- **Principle of Knowledge**: Complexity, Interconnectedness, Interdependence
- **Principle of Life**: Change, Growth, Evolution
- **Principle of Soul**: Purpose, Meaning, Contribution

## Fundamentals of Living Thought

TLT builds upon six foundational areas, linking each field's unique perspective and skill set to enhance our interaction with and impact on various entities:

- **Mathematics** (Explanation): Foundational, Pure, Applied
- **Natural Science** (Rule): Physical/Chemical, Biological/Life, Astro/Geo
- **Technology** (Tool): Extension, Manipulation, Connection
- **Humanities** (Record): Language/Linguistics, Historical/Cultural, Philosophical/Ethical
- **Social Science** (Insight): Societal, Mental, Financial
- **Arts** (Expression): Literary, Visual, Performing

## Pillars of Living Thought

The application of knowledge in TLT is encapsulated within two main pillars that serve as the building blocks for understanding and impacting entities:

- **Applied MNT** (Mathematics, Natural Science, Technology)
- **Applied HSA** (Humanities, Social Science, Arts)

## Competencies of Living Thought

TLT outlines key competencies that entities should strive to develop, divided into intellectual, survival, and professional skills.

## Processes of Living Thought

Entities within TLT undergo a journey through foundational, developmental, and professional stages, culminating in the application, integration, and legacy stages.

## Manifestation of Living Thought

The theory is exemplified through the triad of Society and Civilization, Individual and Consciousness, and Life and the Universe, providing a holistic understanding of existence.
